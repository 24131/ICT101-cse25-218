    <h2>Academic Journey Reflection</h2> 

    <p><em>Published: 04 November 2025</em></p> 

    <p>My journey through university so far has taught me the importance of time management, adaptability, and persistence.  

    In my first semester, balancing coursework and personal life was challenging, but I learned to plan weekly schedules and set realistic goals.  

    Engaging with peers and lecturers also helped me develop stronger communication and teamwork skills. And forming group discussion helped me alot.

    I’ve realized that growth is a continuous process, and learning from challenges is as valuable as celebrating achievements.  

    This reflection motivates me to continue improving both academically and professionally. And through the help of making a study timetable helped me by
    giving me a guide of what to read which helped me balance my assignements and reading time</p>
