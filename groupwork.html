    <h2>Group Work Reflection</h2> 

    <p>Working in a group this semester allowed me to apply Tuckman’s stages of group development.  

    During the <strong>Forming</strong> stage, our team was polite but unsure of roles and did not know how it will be like. But we formed a
    group of 6 members and on our first meeting it was not productivite because people we nervous and did not know their roles. And we made 
    a whatsapp group so that we can communicate with each other regarding the presentation.

    In the <strong>Storming</strong> stage, when we disagreed on punctuctuality, but we resolved it.  

    As we moved into the <strong>Norming</strong> stage, we set clear expectations and improved coordination. And roles became more clearer
    on our second meeting because the members were comfortable with each other and we knew each other's streghths.

    In the <strong>Performing</strong> stage, <!DOCTYPE html>

    <h2>Group Work Reflection</h2> 

    <p>Working in a group this semester allowed me to apply Tuckman’s stages of group development.  

    During the <strong>Forming</strong> stage, our team was polite but unsure of roles.  

    We experienced some <strong>Storming</strong> when we disagreed on task allocation, but we resolved it through open discussions.  

    As we moved into the <strong>Norming</strong> stage, we set clear expectations and improved coordination.  

    In the <strong>Performing</strong> stage, everyone contributed effectively and completed our project successfully.  

    Finally, during <strong>Adjourning</strong>, we reflected on our collaboration and celebrated our teamwork.  

    I learned that communication, respect, and shared responsibility are key to successful group work.</p>
