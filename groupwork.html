    <h2>Group Work Reflection</h2> 

    <p>Working in a group this semester allowed me to apply Tuckman’s stages of group development.  

    During the <strong>Forming</strong> stage, our team was polite but unsure of roles. And members
    were not comfortable around each other and were had to exchange contact details to form a whatsapp 
    group to we can communicate regarding the presentation.

    We experienced some <strong>Storming</strong> when we disagreed on task allocation, because no one 
    wanted to take the role of a chairperon and secretary but we resolved it through open discussions.

    As we moved into the <strong>Norming</strong> stage, we set clear expectations and improved 
    coordination.And the group members became cormfortable aroud each other and roles became more clear
    because each member choose their roles and we developed a sense of harmony

    In the <strong>Performing</strong> stage, everyone contributed effectively and completed our project
    successfully.  

    Finally, during <strong>Adjourning</strong>, we reflected on our collaboration and thanked and
    appreciated our teamwork.  

    I learned that communication, respect, and shared responsibility are key to successful group work.</p>
